The EV_Charging_Prediction project focuses on predicting the future demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging stations based on historical and real-time data. With the rapid adoption of electric vehicles globally, forecasting EV charging demand is crucial for energy providers, urban planners, and charging station operators to optimize resource allocation, reduce power grid load, and improve user satisfaction.

This project leverages data science techniques—such as time-series forecasting, regression models, and machine learning algorithms—to model and predict EV charging usage patterns. The predictions are based on various factors such as historical charging data, timestamps, weather conditions, location of the stations, vehicle types, and user behavior trends.
Outcome:
The project successfully predicts EV charging demand trends with high accuracy and offers actionable insights for improving infrastructure planning and operational efficiency. It lays the foundation for smart city energy planning and supports sustainability by enhancing EV user experience through reduced waiting times and optimized charger distribution.
